What is twodanalysis?
============

`twodanalysis` is a class that helps with the 2D analysis of
membranes and/or biopolymers interacting with a membrane/surface.

It is built on MDAnalysis with the objective of be useful for any
molecular dynamcis engine. Our core runs without problems on the charmm36
force fields, but it is potentially useful for other forcefields with small
changes in the code. In the future, we plan to add support to any forcefield.
This projects is intented to be continously maintaned by the monje group at the
University at Buffalo and GuzmanResearch at Universidad Autonoma de Madrid.

twodanalysis is a an open-source library, where we have made a huge effort to
provide enough details so that the community can twich the code acording to their needs. By doing this,
we hope the code can be useful for the most amount of people. Any bugs or suggestions please open an issue or
send an email to vmonje@buffalo.edu.
