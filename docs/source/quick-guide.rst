Quick guide

In this section, we briefly show how to use `Cumulative2D`, `Voronoi2D`, `PackingDefects`, and `BioPolymer2D` class methods. The
first two classes are intended to project and visualize membrane properties in a two-dimensional fashion, properties that
include (membrane thickness, splay angle, order parameters and area per lipid). `PackingDefects` is suited to easily compute
packing defects for a membrane. Finally, `BioPolymer2D` is intended to help with the study of BioPolymer2D that interact with
surfaces, for example a membrane, however, unlike the previous methods it can be used for other systems.
