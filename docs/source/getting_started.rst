===============

2Danalysis is built to enable systematic analysis of membrane and biopolymers simulations at planar interfaces, projecting biophysical properties onto a two-dimensional plane. Its versatile capabilities enhance the visualization of spatial and temporal changes in lipid membrane structure and mechanics, and support the study of biopolymer adsorption and confinement mechanisms at 2D interfaces. Users can customize the toolbox to study complex 2D phenomena from molecular dynamics simulations.
