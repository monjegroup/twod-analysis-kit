Usage
=====

This software contains two main classes, `Memb2D` and `BioPolymer2D` which should
be imported as follows

.. code-block:: python

   from twodanalysis import Memb2D
   from twodanalysis import BioPolymer2D


Memb2D
------

Memb2D is a class focused on the analysis of membranes in a 2D fashion. It
includes methods such as:

 - Thickness
 - Order parameters
 - APL
 - Packing deffects

These methods use a 2D-grid approach to output 2D matrices.
